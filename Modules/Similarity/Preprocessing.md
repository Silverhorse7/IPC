# Prepocessing CPP Code

The preprocessing of the C++ code is done in the following steps:

1. Remove `#include` directives
2. Remove `using namespace`
3. Remove comments
4. Remove all non-ASCII characters
5. Remove unused functions
6. Replace all macro directives
7. Tokenize the source code

## 1-3. Remove `#include` directives, `using namespace` and comments

A regular expression is used to remove all `#include` directives, `using namespace` and comments from the source code.

## 4. Remove all non-ASCII characters

The removal of non-ASCII characters is done by encoding the source code into ASCII bytes, ignoring any non-ASCII characters, and then decoding those bytes back into a regular string.

## 5 Remove unused functions

The removal of unused functions is done by using the `cppcheck` tool. It is a static code analysis tool for C/C++ code. It provides information about potential issues in the code, such as unused functions. It generates XML output containing information about potential issues in the code. The XML file generated by `cppcheck` is parsed using the xml parsing library, which is `xml.etree.ElementTree`. The xml file is parsed to identify the unused functions and their locations within the code. The identified lines containing unused functions are removed from the code.

## 6. Replace all macro directives

The replacement of macro directives is done by using the `g++` compiler. The `g++` compiler is invoked with specific flags to perform the macro expansion. It replaces any macros within the code with their corresponding definitions, effectively expanding them.


## 7. Tokenize the source code

The tokenization of the source code is done by using the `CppLexer` class from the `pygments` library. The `CppLexer` class is used to tokenize the source code into a list of tokens.

# IPC_Scrapers

_Messy_ scrappers that are used to build a comprehensive dataset (one of the **largest** of its kind) of problems and solutions from various online judges used in competitive programming. 

All solutions are in C++.

## Dataset

Tags and problem difficulty were also scraped for judges that contain that data.

I don't "own" the data scraped, the online judges do. Use this data and code however you want.
